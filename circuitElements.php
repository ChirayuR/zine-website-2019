               And the journey startsðŸ˜€. Letâ€™s start with some conceptual things. So in this blog, we will study circuit
               elements. What are these and where do we see them in daily life and robotics?ðŸ¤”

               But before starting with circuit elements, do you know what a circuit is?
               A circuit is an arrangement of individual electronic components, such as resistors, transistors,
               capacitors, inductors, and diodes, connected by conductive wires or traces through which electric current
               can flow.</div>
            Now letâ€™s understand this with a hypothetical activity. <br> <br>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  Required equipment:

                  <br> <br>
                  In case you have your real-world LED, switch, battery, and wires, they will work better, but if you
                  donâ€™t have them, you can take these hypothetical ones. Assume them to be similar to the real-world
                  ones.</li>
               <li>
                  <img src="./images/image16.png" class="img-responsive floating-image right">
                  Now, you need to connect a piece of wire to each terminal of LED and analyze whether it is a
                  circuit according to the definition.
                  Is it a circuit? No, itâ€™s not because it does not make a closed path. (The one in red is the
                  positive terminal and the one in black is negative)</li>
               <li>
                  <img src="./images/image11.png" class="img-responsive floating-image left" width="100px"
                     height="100px">
                  Now, connect the end terminals of wire extending from the terminals of LED and connect them.
                  <br><br>
                  Is it a circuit now? Even though you have closed the loop, it cannot be called an electric circuit
                  because of the absence of the flow of electric current since the power source is absent. So, you
                  need to add a power source.
                  <br>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <img src="./images/image3.png" class="img-responsive floating-image right" width="100px"
                     height="100px">

                  Disconnect the wire ends from each other and connect them to the battery in a way that the wire
                  from the longer terminal of the LED connects to the positive terminal of the battery and that from
                  the shorter terminal of the LED must connect to the negative terminal of the battery.

               </li>
            </ol>
            <br> <br>
            <div>
               Youâ€™ll notice that your LED will start to glow, and voila! Youâ€™ve created your very first circuit.
               Now you must be wondering why we needed the switch to
               demonstrate about circuits, we donâ€™t really. Our elementary electric circuit is now complete. But we
               need a switch to illustrate some more concepts.<p>
                  <br> <br>
                  <div>
                     Suppose you connect a switch in series with your circuit, but the simple on/off switch can only
                     have two states, on or off, and takes only one of them at once.
               </p>

               <p>
                  <table style="border: 2px solid black;">
                     <tr>
                        <th>
                           <p>A quick question - would the arrangement still be called a circuit if I set the
                              switch in the OFF state? There is no flow of electric current, so it defies the
                              definition of a circuit.
                              Try and think by yourself! If it is, why? Consider this as an assignment to
                              yourself. Contact us with your doubts.

                        </th>
                     </tr>
                  </table>
                  <p>
                     Now that you know what exactly is a circuit, letâ€™s study the types of circuit elements.
