        Look at the picture of a house and try to decode the basic structural unit of it.<br />

        Yeah, guys! we know all of you know it's a brick. But what about these? Can you tell their smallest electronic component?<br />
        Or we may reframe our question as to what is the building block of all major electronic devices?<br>
        Yeah, it's nothing but a small diode. So now let's get to its super simple definition.ðŸ˜ƒ<br><br>
        In simple words, diode or di-ode or di-electrode is an electronic component that conducts current primarily in one direction; it has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other.<br>
        Youâ€™ll get a better understanding with a diagram,<br>
        Now, you might be curious to know how it works.<br>
        In this semiconductor, the majority charge carriers are holes whereas minority charge carriers are electrons<br>
