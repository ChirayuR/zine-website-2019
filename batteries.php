            If you are getting interested in robotics, you are going to need a lot of different types of batteries for different uses, you'll need to know how to use them and understand the various ratings and specs. There are primary, secondary batteries, there are Li-ion and Li-Po batteries and much more. Why do we need batteries? Answer is simple: imagine a world without batteries. All those portable devices we’re so dependent on would be so limited! We’d only be able to take our laptops and phones as far as the reach of their cables, making that new running app you just downloaded onto your phone fairly useless.

            And why so different types of batteries?
            <br>
            Imagine you want to make a simple circuit, say just a simple led on and off or you want to build a drone for a drone racing competition. How does it all get powered up? Yes, we need batteries for that. For different applications, you may need different properties of a power source say for turning led on and off you just need a 2V or 3V battery with low current rates but drones motors require high current rates with a larger voltage supply. So different types of battery chemistry affect their application. Let us first study how batteries work.
