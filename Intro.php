Hola amigos!<br />
Zine welcomes you all to this wonderful world of Robotics.<br />
Yâ€™all must be fascinated with robots like WALL-E, Optimus Prime, BayMax, and many more. These sci-fi movie robots have not only entertained us but also helped us realize the upcoming future. You know what, we are slowly entering this world of fantasy. Engineers have already amazed us with their creations like ASIMO, PEPPER, NAO, MIRO, AIBO, ATLAS, MEENA, and trust us, it's just a start.
<br />So, what is Robotics? <br />
Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering, and technology that produces machines, called robots, that substitute for (or replicate) human actions. Simple isn't it. Earlier, it was meant to be used in the manufacturing sector only. Now, people are using robots at home, in hospitals, airports, and many more. So, let's begin our journey. But before that Beep Beep Boop Boop Beep...<br />

<br />Yeah, those above are robots!ðŸ˜ƒ<br />
<img src="./images/2.gif" class="img-responsive floating-image left">
<img src="./images/3.gif" class="img-responsive floating-image right" style="width: 500px; height: 300px;"><br />
And those too! ðŸ˜… The one on left is an obstacle-avoiding bot and the right one is a line follower bot.<br />

Now you all must be curious to know how we build them? How is a robot able to do things automatically? Does it go through the same thought process as a person would in the same situation? Does it even have a thought process of its own?ðŸ™„ You will learn all this over your journey on these blogs. 
Let's understand robots by taking an analogy with humans. Like humans have a brain, heart, and body, robots also have a brain (Integrated Circuits and Microcontrollers), heart ( Basic Electrical and Electronics), and body (Basic Mechanical Engineering).
<br /><br />
Letâ€™s find out our first infinity stone. As we mentioned BEE is the heart of robotics, your robot may look good, complete from the outside, and might have a good structure but without the heart (BEE), the structure of your robot is no more than a corpse.
<br /><br />
Youâ€™ll understand the importance of BEE by resembling it with the heart of a human.<br />
If BEE is the heart of a robot then simply wire can be compared with arteries and veins, and as we need the circulation of blood in different parts of the body to keep it functioning, similarly flow of electrons is necessary for working of different parts of the robot, e.g motors, sensors, and other electric and electronic elements all connected using wires.

Yes, yes, WiFi and Bluetooth donâ€™t use wires at all but they arenâ€™t exceptions guys, itâ€™s just electronics doing telepathy. ðŸ˜‰ <br />
<br />
Let's start with basics but first, do you know the difference between electrical and electronics? Why do we need two separate fields in which both of them have to deal with electricity? Ever wondered why do we have electrical engineering and electronics engineering as separate branches in college? Think! Try a little harder! Still not getting it? No problemo.<br />
<br />
Weâ€™ll work this out with an activity. Consider a bulb and a television screen.
